# Chrome Extension Idea: StyleShift

## Authors

## Problem Statement
Oftentimes users would like to have an LLM generate content but one that matches the context of a particular format. That is, often the same piece of content needs to be repurposed for different audiences. Manually adapting the textâ€™s tone and style across formats (e.g., emails, academic papers, marketing materials) requires significant effort and expertise. Rewriting or reformatting text to meet various style guidelines is a tedious and error-prone process, diverting focus from core tasks and reducing productivity. The Extension will help address this issue by giving the user the option to pick from preselected writing styles or provide their own personal style for the LLM to match to. 

## Target Audience

- Business Professionals & Executives:
- Content Creators & Copywriters:
- Academics & Researchers:
- Job Seekers & Career Professionals:
