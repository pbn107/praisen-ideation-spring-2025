# Chrome Extension Idea: MyScholar

## Authors

## Problem Statement

Many people in both academia and industry need to find and parse through research related to their current interests or challenges. This often involves searching a database like Google Scholar, then slowly reading a (usually dense) paper until it becomes clear it is not relevant or helpful, then moving onto the next. This extension allows users to speed up this process by allowing them to type in the fields they are interested in, and find relevant, summarized articles. 

## Target Audience

Those who will benefit most include students and researchers in academia, but also those in industry whose work relies on staying updated on current research.

## Description

Users input reserach topics, and finds recent papers matching this topic. It then returns quick summaries of these articles.

## Selling Points

1. Matches topics automatically - user enter research interests; the extension finds matching papers.
2. Paper summaries - short, digestible summaries of key sections.
3. Moving away from exact matches - search on Google Scholar is often inaccurate and obtuse (for example, searching "senescence" but not getting relevant articles on "cell aging" because you did not use the exact wording as the titles). Our , and will look up articles with information synonymous with the search term you are looking for.
4. Can keep certain topics on stand-by - for example, if you are continuously interested in a particular field like aging, the extension will repeatedly update you
5. Reduces time to find relevant papers
