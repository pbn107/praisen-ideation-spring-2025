# Chrome Extension Idea: SmartScheduler

## Authors

## Problem Statement

Professionals and busy individuals often waste time toggling between their email and calendar to propose meeting times. This back‑and‑forth is tedious, error‑prone (especially across time zones), and can delay scheduling by days. SmartScheduler eliminates this friction by automatically reading meeting requests in your inbox, scanning your calendar availability, and drafting a polished, natural‑language reply with multiple time options—all in one click.

## Target Audience

- Professionals who coordinate frequent meetings across teams and clients.

- Freelancers and consultants juggling varied client schedules.

- Recruiters & HR teams setting up interviews with candidates in different time zones.

- Small business owners who manage both administrative tasks and client communications.

- Busy undividuals (e.g., students, researchers) who want to streamline their scheduling workflow.

## Description

SmartScheduler is a Chrome Extension that integrates with your webmail (Gmail, Outlook Web) and Google or Microsoft Calendar. When you click “Reply” to a message asking for your availability, the extension instantly analyzes your upcoming calendar slots, selects three well‑spaced options, and generates a friendly, professional response like:

“I’m free Monday 2–4 pm, Wednesday after 3 pm, or Friday morning—does any of that work for you?”

You can customize how many options to offer, preferred meeting lengths, and even time‑zone formatting.

## Selling Points

1. One‑Click Scheduling – Instantly draft availability replies without leaving your inbox.

2. Time‑Zone Smart – Automatically adjusts suggestions to the recipient’s time zone.

3. Customizable Preferences – Set preferred meeting durations and working hours.

4. Polished Language – Generates friendly, professional prose.

5. Privacy‑First – Calendar data is processed locally; no sensitive information is stored or shared (only free times are shared with LLMs).

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to quickly reply to “When are you free?” emails so that I can focus on higher‑value tasks.

- As a recruiter, I want to offer interview slots adjusted to the candidate’s time zone so that scheduling is seamless.

- As a consultant, I want to set default meeting lengths so that I don't get double‑booked.

- As a small business owner, I want to propose three diverse time options so that clients have flexibility without extra emails.

- As an academic, I want to maintain a consistent, polite tone in scheduling emails so that communications remain professional.

## Notes

Integration: Supports Gmail, Outlook Web, Google Calendar, and Microsoft 365 Calendar via OAuth.

Customization Panel: Users can adjust working hours, preferred meeting lengths (15/30/60 min), and number of options.

Fallback Handling: If no slots are available, it can suggest “Let me know if you have preferred times, and I’ll adjust accordingly.”

Security: All calendar parsing occurs in the browser; no data is sent to external servers.

Other Notes: Integration might be the most tedious part of the project given that it supports Google and Microsoft services. However, it is unavoidable and the project's value proposition is worth the effort.
