# Chrome Extension Idea: [Title]

## Authors

Alan Wu

## Problem Statement

Recipe websites are incentivized to create long, bloated pages to maximize ad revenue. This makes it frustrating for users who just want the actual recipe. Even when they reach the recipe, it may not suit their needs — they might be missing ingredients, need a different portion size, or follow specific dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, halal, gluten-free, allergies).

## Target Audience

The target audience for this extension is home cooks — especially those who value convenience, customization, and dietary accommodations.

## Description

This Chrome extension scrapes the recipe content from bloated web pages and generates a custom prompt that is copied directly to the user’s clipboard. Users can check boxes to select dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, halal, gluten-free, nut-free) and desired portion sizes. When pasted into an LLM (like ChatGPT), the prompt will generate a tailored, clean recipe.

## Selling Points

1. Saves time — Skips long-winded intros, ads, and popups to get straight to the recipe.
2. Customization — Adjusts recipes to fit specific dietary needs and portion sizes.
3. Clipboard-ready prompt — Clean and formatted for direct LLM use.
4. Diet-aware cooking — Helps users discover recipe alternatives that work for their lifestyle.
5. Minimal UI — A lightweight extension with a simple interface and powerful results.

## User Stories

1. As a home cook, I want to extract only the core recipe from a blog so that I don’t waste time scrolling.
2. As a vegan user, I want to filter out non-vegan ingredients so that I can still enjoy the recipe.
3. As someone cooking for two, I want to scale down a recipe designed for six people so that I don’t waste food.
4. As a user with a peanut allergy, I want the extension to flag or replace peanut-containing ingredients so that I stay safe.
5. As a curious cook, I want to copy a prompt to my clipboard quickly so that I can paste it into ChatGPT for enhanced instructions.
