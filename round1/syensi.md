# Chrome Extension Idea:  One-Click ChatGPT Integration

## Problem Statement

[Describe the problem that your Chrome Extension will solve. What are the pain points that users experience? How does your extension address these pain points?]
- LeetCode problems often include lengthy descriptions, complex sample code, and large test cases. Manually copying and pasting these elements into ChatGPT is time-consuming and error-prone
- Users often struggle to extract specific code lines or test cases from LeetCode’s editor (e.g., "Why does this loop fail?"). Copying fragments without the full problem context forces users to spend extra time re-explaining the scenario to ChatGPT.
- When users ask ChatGPT for help, they must manually explain the problem context (e.g., "This line of code doesn’t work with the third test case"). Without structured input, ChatGPT may misinterpret the request, leading to irrelevant or generic responses.

## Target Audience

[Identify the target audience for your Chrome Extension. Who will benefit from using your extension? What are the main characteristics of your target audience?]
- Job Seekers for Software Development Roles
- University student who studying data structure and algorithm
- Coding competition participants

## Description

[Provide a general description of your Chrome Extension idea in 2-3 sentences. Explain the main purpose and functionality of the extension.]
This Chrome Extension streamlines the process of seeking AI assistance for LeetCode problem-solving by **automatically extracting code, problem descriptions, and test cases** directly from the LeetCode editor. With one click, it structures this data into context-rich prompts and sends them to *ChatGPT*, eliminating manual copy-pasting and fragmented explanations. Its **core purpose** is to turn ChatGPT into a targeted coding assistant that understands both the problem’s constraints and the user’s specific struggles, and saving time for users to learning from code and problems.


## Selling Points

1. **One-Click Extraction** : Automatically extracts code, problem descriptions, and test cases from the LeetCode editor with a single click.
2. **Context Integration**: Integrates problem descriptions, code, and test cases into structured prompts for ChatGPT
3. **Privacy protection**: Data is processed locally to prevent sensitive code or problem leaks to third-party servers.
4. **Multi-language support**: Multi-language is supported by AI, attracting user from diverge background
5. **Multi-Format Support**: Supports exporting data in plain text, Markdown, or JSON formats for compatibility with ChatGPT and other AI tools.

## User Stories

%% _[List user stories that describe the main features of your Chrome Extension. Use the following template: "As a [user role], I want to [goal] so that [benefit]." Fill in the brackets with the appropriate information. For Round 1, write 5 user stories; Round 2, write 10 user stories; Round 3, write 15 user stories.]_ %%
1. As a job seeker preparing for technical interviews, I want to speed up on finding the problem of my coding
2. As a university student struggling with a complex algorithm,  I want to right-click a confusing code line in the LeetCode editor and know the meaning of them

## Notes
