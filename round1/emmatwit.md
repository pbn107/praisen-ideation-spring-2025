**Chrome Extension Idea: ** Breaking Chains

**Authors ** Emma Twitmyer, Lisa K. Ayisi-Ahwireng, Luna Chen, Allen Liu

**Problem Statement** 
When email chains get too long, it is hard to find the relevant information and context amongst the increasing indentation, different authors, and email content itself. Especially if you are looped into an email chain once it has begun. This chrome extension can take an email chain from Gmail and provide a summary of the entire conversation, as well as an email-to-email breakdown of what has been said without pleasantries. The user can use this gathered data to (a) gain a better understanding and (b) prompt ChatGPT for what to respond to, and how to respond. 

**Target Audience**
Anyone who works on email and finds themselves interacting with many other offices/people, especially when these stakeholders have different motivations and goals/novel information within the email chain. I am thinking of administrators, C-Suite, Project leads. 

**Description**
A pop-up in Gmail that when activated will scrape the open email chain to provide a summary of the conversation, a email by email runthrough, and an explanation of what the receiver is asked for. 

**Selling Points**
1. Saves Time
2. Saves Frustration
3. Increases productivity
4. More visually accessible
