## Problem Statement

Users experience difficulty extracting key insights from their Google Calendar. In particular, they might find it manual to determine their windows of availability within a given time period. This Chrome Extension will allow users to identify quickly when they are available within a given time period, for a specific period of time. 

## Target Audience

All Google Calendar users can benefit from this Chrome Extension, although it will particularly benefit those who regularly need to provide their availability to schedule meetings or appointments. They are likely busy students or working individuals who maintain their life on Google Calendar.

## Description

This Chrome Extension will enable users to quickly extract their availability based on their Google Calendar events. By simply logging in via OAuth, the extension will access the user’s calendar data and then calculate available time slots based on user-defined parameters, such as their working hours. The extension will generate a list of free time slots that users can copy and share for scheduling meetings or appointments.

## Selling Points

1. Automatically determine free time slots within a given period (e.g. next week, next month)
2. Seamlessly login with Google OAuth for easy data access
3. Define your work hours and days (e.g. Monday-Friday) for more accurate availability results
4. Provide users with easy-to-copy, formatted availability times to paste into emails
5. Saves time by replacing the manual process of checking calendar slots

## User Stories

As a busy professional, I want to extract my availability from Google Calendar so that I can quickly find free slots for meetings.


As a student, I want to set my working hours (e.g., 9am-3pm) and easily see when I’m free for study sessions.


As a freelancer, I want to extract free time slots for the next week and send them to my clients for scheduling.


As a project manager, I want to check the availability of team members (by connecting to their calendars) for meeting planning.


As a parent, I want to quickly see free time for personal appointments between work hours.

## Notes

The extension will be read-only access to Google Calendar for privacy and security reasons.

It will also have an option for users to manually adjust their availability slot if needed (e.g. if they want to reserve a block of time for personal use, even if it’s not blocked off on their calendar.
