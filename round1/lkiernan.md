# Chrome Extension Idea: CanvasGeneration

## Problem Statement

My Chrome Extension would solve the problem of people not being organized with their time and not being able to portion it accordingly. Users experience the "pain points" 
of not knowing how much time a task will take, underestimating their work, or not having a unified view of what is happening in the coming weeks of their 
coursework. This extension would address those pain points by having calendar generation capabilities and the ability to estimate how long it would take you to complete a task.
It would also be able to synthesize and unify the classes into one service that has them classes demistyfied in one small extension.

## Target Audience

My target audience is college students, or anyone who uses the canvas website. They will benefit from this extension because it perfectly addresses problems that 
are specific to them. Oftentimes this student would be busy or overwhelmed by coursework, where the stress could be alleviated by this extension.

## Description

My Chrome extension idea is one that connects to your Canvas and scrapes the website to take syllabi, assignments, and file sections into account to 
generate either a daily plan, a weekly plan, or a monthly plan. It would ideally take into account how long each task would take, and the "pressing"
nature of each assignment when generating this plan. It also would ideally ensure that you are up to date in your classes by telling you what you 
will be covering that week.

## Selling Points

1. Calendar Generation
2. Timing estimation
3. Coursework Updating
4. Description Summaries
5. Condensing of class information

## User Stories

_[List user stories that describe the main features of your Chrome Extension. Use the following template: "As a [user role], I want to [goal] so that [benefit]." Fill in the brackets with the appropriate information. For Round 1, write 5 user stories; Round 2, write 10 user stories; Round 3, write 15 user stories.]_

As a student in a poorly organized class, I want to know what is due this week without having to search through the syllabus or files pages.

As a student overwhelmed by coursework, I want to know how much time I have to balance the multitude of classes that I am taking.

As an inexperienced computer science sudent, I want to know how long an assignment should take without having to read the whole document of the rules.

As a studnet who procrastinates, I want to be told how far in advance to work on something. 

As a student who is bad at organizing, I want an extension to do that work for me.
