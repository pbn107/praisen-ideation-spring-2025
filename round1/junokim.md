## Problem Statement

Networking Automator solves the problem of filling out the same template every single time when networking. The main pain point is that the initial cold email is often just a formality, and the actual networking occurs when following up through a meeting, and the extension aims to make this tedious process quick and easy.

## Target Audience

The target audience is students reaching out to professionals for advice. This will mainly be for those who are networking, so main characteristics is they will want to reach out to people in specific roles, or people at specific companies, and/or they have something in common with. Another common characteristic is that they will want to prioritize time, as networking is often a quantity-focused endeavor.

## Description

Networking Automator provides for a streamlined experience in networking with professionals via Linkedin. On Linkedin, after navigating to someone’s profile, you will see their personal email address, at which point the extension will generate a standardized template that you can edit and customize before sending, all from the convenience of a side menu without leaving Linkedin. After sending, the extension will keep track of those you have networked with, and recommend other people to reach out to.

## Selling Points

1. Saves time writing the same template
2. Allows for still genuine messages with editing before sending
3. Convenience in just going through linkedin, not opening other websites
4. Saves information of last status update so I can track progress
5. Gives good recommendations of who to reach out to next, or other ppl in network
