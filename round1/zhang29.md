# Chrome Extension Idea: Discord Thread Extractor

## Authors

## Problem Statement

Discord’s fast-paced text channels make it difficult to revisit or extract past conversations. Users reading chat history asynchronously must scroll up frequently, often losing their place as new messages arrive. There’s also no easy way to archive or copy conversations cleanly for later use, such as summaries or receipts. This extension solves these pain points by enabling quick, clean extraction of Discord threads.

## Target Audience

- Students, researchers, or professionals who use Discord for group discussions or collaboration.

- Content creators or community managers summarizing chat highlights.

- Users who use LLMs to summarize, analyze, or reformat long Discord threads.

- Anyone who wants to archive or reference parts of a Discord conversation.

## Description

This Chrome extension allows users to select a range of Discord messages and extract them into a clean, readable format. It strips away unnecessary UI elements and metadata, formatting the text in a way that's ideal for input into LLMs. Users can copy the cleaned thread or export it to a file.

## Selling Points

1. One-click extraction of full Discord threads or selected message ranges.

2. Clean formatting optimized for pasting into LLMs like ChatGPT or Claude.

3. Works on both web and desktop (browser-accessed) versions of Discord.

4. Option to export as plain text or markdown for easy integration with note-taking apps.

5. Privacy-first: runs entirely locally in the browser without uploading any data.

## User Stories

1. As a student, I want to extract a project discussion from Discord so that I can summarize it using ChatGPT.

2. As a researcher, I want to save and organize my team's brainstorm conversations so that I can reference them later.

3. As a content creator, I want to copy interesting community debates from Discord so that I can turn them into video or blog content.

4. As a productivity nerd, I want to pull conversations into Notion or Obsidian with markdown formatting so that I can archive team progress.

5. As a LLM user and gossip lover, I want to paste clean conversation threads into a chatbot without manual formatting so that I can get better summaries from Discord drama channel.

## Notes

Might need to start building with ticket transcripts (static and shorter) first before going into real-time text channels.
