# Chrome Extension Idea: SmartMeeting Reply

## Problem Statement

cheduling meetings over email is often tedious and time-consuming. When someone asks “When are you free?”, users typically have to manually open their calendar, check their availability, and then write a natural-sounding response. This back-and-forth wastes time and can result in awkward or unclear availability sharing.

SmartMeeting Reply solves this by automatically scanning the user’s Google Calendar and drafting a polite, natural-language response based on real-time availability. It simplifies scheduling and eliminates friction in email-based coordination.

## Target Audience
- Busy professionals and students who frequently schedule meetings via email
- People who rely on Google Calendar for planning
- Individuals working in fast-paced environments with frequent calendar changes
- Remote teams, consultants, interviewers, and event planners

## Description

SmartMeeting Reply is a Chrome Extension that integrates with Gmail and Google Calendar. When it detects scheduling-related emails (e.g., “When are you free?”), it auto-generates a friendly, human-sounding reply suggesting time slots based on your availability — all without leaving your inbox.

## Selling Points

1. Automatically scans your calendar for open time slots
2. Drafts natural, polite responses directly in your email thread
3. Saves time by eliminating calendar/email switching
4. Detects tone and context to adjust response style
5. Keeps your personal boundaries by excluding blocked, travel, or personal events

## User Stories

1. As a busy student, I want to quickly respond to meeting requests so that I can save time during my day.
2. As a freelancer, I want the extension to suggest my open time slots so that I can schedule client calls without manual back-and-forth.
3. As a manager, I want my calendar to be automatically scanned so that I don’t double-book my time.
4. As an email user, I want to receive a draft message in natural language so that I can sound polite and professional without rewriting it myself.
5. As a remote worker, I want to see suggested times in both my time zone and the recipient’s, so that I avoid confusion.

## Notes

- Could offer customization (e.g., how many slots to suggest, how formal the language should be).
- Potential integration with Microsoft Outlook or other calendar systems in the future.
- Might include a privacy toggle to exclude certain calendar labels (like “Personal” or “Private”).
- Consider security: limited calendar read-access, no data storage.
