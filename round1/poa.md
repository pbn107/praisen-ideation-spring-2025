## Problem Statement

[Describe the problem that your Chrome Extension will solve. What are the pain points that users experience? How does your extension address these pain points?]

Research academics may struggle with information overload when reviewing research papers online. They have to navigate multiple sites, extract references manually, and generate citations in different formats. This extension addresses these points by automatically detecting and extracting key metadata from research papers, offering streamlined summaries, and generating citations—ultimately saving users time and effort.

## Target Audience

[Identify the target audience for your Chrome Extension. Who will benefit from using your extension? What are the main characteristics of your target audience?]

Graduate students who need quick access to paper details and citations, researchers and faculty who frequently browse academic websites, librarians responsible for organizing scholarly materials, professionals in scientific roles who need to stay updated on the latest research, and more.

## Description

[Provide a general description of your Chrome Extension idea in 2-3 sentences. Explain the main purpose and functionality of the extension.]

This Chrome Extension automatically extracts structured metadata from online research papers—whether on arXiv, Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar, or other websites. Once installed, it presents a popup showing key details such as title, authors, abstract, and references. Users can also access features like summarizing abstracts, explaining methods, generating citations, and discovering related papers through integrated scholarly APIs.

## Selling Points
1. Automated metadata extraction
2. Quick summaries and explanations
3. Easy citation generation
4. References & citation scraper
5. Integration with Research APIs

## User Stories

1. As a graduate student, I want to automatically extract the abstract of a paper so that I can quickly decide if it’s relevant to my research.
2. As a researcher, I want to see a simple list of references so that I can easily locate all cited works.
3. As a librarian, I want to generate citations so that I can efficiently organize references for my institution’s database.
4. As a student, I want to read a simplified summary of the methods section so that I can understand complex methodologies without getting lost in jargon.
5. As a self-learner, I want to discover related papers so that I can expand my knowledge in a given area.

## Notes

-Parsing DOM structures can vary across different websites. Maintaining accurate extraction requires ongoing updates to site-specific scraping rules or using official APIs where possible

-Alternative approach: Utilize direct APIs to reduce reliance on HTML parsing; incorporate advanced NLP techniques for summarization.

-Key features: user-friendly interface with a sidebar or popup, citation generation, and discovery of related papers, plus an open API for advanced users who want to integrate ScholarSense data into their workflows.
