# Chrome Extension Idea: Ticket Price Watcher

## Authors

## Problem Statement

Many people want to wait for ticket prices to drop below a certain amount before they will buy. It is difficult to be constantly monitoring ticket prices, since there is a large window of time customers can buy, and ticket prices change often.

## Target Audience

Concert, show, sports game goers on a budget that frequently use sites like Ticketmaster, Stubhub, VividSeats, and SeatGeek. They are most likely casual fans and do not buy tickets at face value when they first come out.

## Description

This chrome extension allows users to choose certain events on Ticketmaster, Stubhub, VividSeats, and SeatGeek (or perhaps limit to only one or two sites). They can choose the areas they want seats in and what price they would be willing to buy for, and the extension will monitor those seats and notify the user if a seat drops to that price or lower.

## Selling Points

1. Automate price watching so users don't have to check
2. Be the first to get tickets when tickets are a certain price
3. See ticket price trends over time

## User Stories

As a budget concert goer, I want to buy tickets at a certain price.

## Notes

One issue is that if Chrome is ever shut down or closed completely, users may have to reenter their data into the chrome extension in order for it to keep monitoring. Also will have to constantly be running in the background? How often should ticket prices be scraped--once/twice a day? More often?
