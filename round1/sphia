# Chrome Extension Idea: Smart Email Calendar Scheduler

## Authors

## Problem Statement

Scheduling meetings over email is often time-consuming and repetitive. When someone asks, "When are you free to meet next week?", users typically have to switch tabs, check their calendar, and manually type out their availability. This workflow is especially inefficient for busy professionals managing multiple events.

Our extension reduces this friction by automatically generating natural-language availability responses based on the user’s calendar, streamlining the scheduling process.

## Target Audience

 -Professionals and students with busy schedules

 -People who rely on Google Calendar or similar platforms for daily organization

 -Users who frequently coordinate meetings via email (e.g., managers, freelancers, academic advisors)

 -Individuals looking to automate repetitive communication tasks

## Description

This Chrome extension scans your Google Calendar when you receive scheduling-related emails. It drafts a polite, natural-language response suggesting your free time slots, such as:
“I’m free Monday 2–4pm, Wednesday after 3, or Friday morning — does any of that work for you?”

The user can review and edit the draft before sending.

## Selling Points

1. Saves time by eliminating the need to manually check and write availability

2. Generates natural, polite language rather than rigid calendar invites

3. Integrates directly into your email interface for seamless use

4. Integrates securely with Gmail and Google Calendar via OAuth

5. Works in the background with no need to switch apps
