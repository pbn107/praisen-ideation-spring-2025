# Chrome Extension Idea: **JobCopy Pro: Smart Prompts for LinkedIn**

### Authors

### Problem Statement

Job seekers often rely on LinkedIn to browse job descriptions and use tools like ChatGPT to rewrite resumes, tailor cover letters, or compare required skills. However, copying the job description manually and crafting an effective prompt takes time and effort. This slows down the job application process and may result in poorly tailored materials. Our extension solves this by allowing users to copy both the job description **and** a **preset, high-quality prompt** to the clipboard in a single click, ready to paste into ChatGPT for immediate use.

### Target Audience

This extension is designed for job seekers, students, professionals switching careers, and anyone who uses ChatGPT to assist with job applications. These users value speed, customization, and high-quality prompts to make their application stand out. It also benefits users who are new to prompt engineering and want better results from AI tools.

### Description

JobCopy Pro is a Chrome Extension for LinkedIn that allows users to click a button to copy a job description along with a preset, optimized ChatGPT prompt. Users can choose from several prompt options—like “rewrite my resume,” “compare this job to my current skillset,” or “generate a custom cover letter.” This saves time and boosts the quality of AI-assisted job application workflows.

### Selling Points

1. One-click job description + prompt copying from LinkedIn  
2. Includes curated, high-performing prompts for ChatGPT  
3. Helps users generate personalized content instantly  
4. Reduces time spent crafting good AI inputs  
5. Great for users new to prompt engineering or ChatGPT  

### User Stories

1. As a job seeker, I want to copy a job description and a prompt together so that I can instantly paste it into ChatGPT for a resume rewrite.  
2. As a student, I want to compare a job's requirements to my skills so that I know where I need to improve.  
3. As someone unfamiliar with prompt writing, I want preset options that help me get better responses from ChatGPT.  
4. As a busy professional, I want to save time by skipping manual prompt creation.  
5. As a user, I want to choose from different types of prompts so that I can generate cover letters, summaries, or skill gap analyses.

### Notes

- The extension could include a small UI dropdown that lets users choose which type of prompt they want to copy with the job description.
- We'll need to manage formatting so the clipboard copy is clean and properly structured.
- Could include a “custom prompt” option where users save their own template.
- A future update might let users paste directly into ChatGPT in another tab.
