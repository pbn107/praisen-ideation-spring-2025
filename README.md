# CIS 3500-001 — Project Ideation — Spring 2025

This repository is for the ideation of the project. It is a place to share ideas and discuss them.

## How to use `TEMPLATE-1.md`

Accurately filling out the template is crucial for the success of your project. The template is designed to help you think through your idea and present it clearly.

⚠️ Make sure to **replace any text in brackets** with your own content. The brackets are there to help you understand what to put in each section. For example, if it says `[Title]`, replace it with the title of your idea.

⚠️ **Do not include the brackets in your final submission.**

⚠️ Make sure to **delete any text in italics** (i.e., _this_) before submitting. The italics are there to help you understand what to put in each section. For example, if it says _[Include your name(s) here]_, replace it with your name(s).

## In-Class Ideation (Rounds 1-3)

For this phase, use [`TEMPLATE-1.md`](TEMPLATE-1.md) to structure your ideas, replace the prompts in between brackets, and submit using a pull request in folders `round1`, `round2`, and `round3`.

### At Each Round

- [Create a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)
- Write a new file in the `roundX` directory with your PennKey and the `.md` extension (i.e., I would write a file called `lumbroso.md`) according to `TEMPLATE.md` (see also `SAMPLE-1.md` and `SAMPLE-2.md` for examples).
- [Create a pull request from the fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)

### Rounds

Here are how the rounds are structured:

- **Round 1 (15-20 mins):** Think on your own about a single story that you will submit in `round1` directory.

# Chrome Extension Idea: **SkillSpotter – Smart Skill Extraction for Job Applications**

## Problem Statement

Job seekers often browse through numerous job postings across platforms like Handshake, LinkedIn, and Indeed. However, it's tedious and time-consuming to manually extract, compare, and keep track of frequently required skills, especially for those applying across different roles or industries.

This lack of visibility into overlapping skill requirements makes it difficult for users to focus their learning and job preparation efficiently.

**SkillSpotter** addresses this by allowing users to highlight important content in job descriptions directly from their browser and automatically aggregates the key skills, creating a prioritized list of the most in-demand qualifications.

---

## Target Audience

- **University students** preparing for internships or full-time roles
- **Recent graduates** entering the job market
- **Career switchers** looking to align their skillsets with current industry demands
- **Job seekers** using online platforms such as Handshake, LinkedIn, and Indeed

## Description

**SkillSpotter** is a Chrome Extension that enables users to highlight job postings across career websites and automatically extracts and aggregates frequently mentioned skills. It visualizes common requirements, tracks trends across roles, and helps users focus on the most essential competencies for their job search.

## Selling Points

1. ✅ **No scraping required** – user-driven highlighting keeps it site-agnostic and lightweight.
2. 🧠 **Skill frequency analysis** – instantly identifies the most commonly listed skills across multiple job descriptions.
3. 📊 **Visual dashboard** – view skill frequency with charts and export your data for personal planning.
4. 📝 **Cross-session memory** – saves your highlights even if you close or refresh the browser.
5. 🔒 **User privacy-focused** – no external scraping or intrusive permissions needed.

## Notes

- Optional AI integration could auto-suggest common skills or categorize skills into technical, soft, and domain-specific clusters.
- Minimal permissions required – emphasizing local storage for privacy and simplicity.
- Could integrate with resume or LinkedIn improvement tools in the future.
- Scope can be adjusted for MVP: start with basic highlighting and frequency counting, then expand to dashboard and export features.
