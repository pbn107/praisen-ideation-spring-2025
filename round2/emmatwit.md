**Problem Statement** 
When email chains get too long, it becomes difficult to find relevant information and context amidst increasing indentation, multiple authors, and redundant or unrelated email content. This challenge is especially prevalent when individuals are looped into an ongoing email thread. Breaking Chains is a Chrome extension designed to work with Gmail, providing users with a concise summary of the entire conversation, as well as a step-by-step breakdown of each email, filtering out pleasantries and irrelevant details. The gathered data can be used to (a) gain a better understanding of the conversation’s progression and (b) prompt ChatGPT for guidance on how to respond effectively.


**Target Audience**
This extension is designed for anyone who frequently interacts with lengthy or complex email threads, including:
- Administrators
- Executives
- Project Leads
- Customer Support Teams
- Researchers collaborating via email
- Business Development Managers

These users often have to sift through long conversations where various stakeholders bring different motivations, goals, or unique pieces of information.

**Description**
Breaking Chains is a Chrome extension integrated directly into Gmail. When activated, it provides the user with:
- A summary of the entire conversation, highlighting key points and decisions.
- An email-by-email breakdown, filtering out pleasantries, repetitive information, and irrelevant details.
- Identification of action items or requests, allowing the user to quickly understand what they are being asked to do or contribute.
- ChatGPT integration for drafting responses or providing suggestions based on the conversation summary.
- The extension presents this information through a clean, accessible pop-up interface that overlays the Gmail window, providing immediate utility without disrupting the workflow.

**Selling Points** 
1. Saves Time: Reduces time spent parsing through lengthy email threads.
2. Saves Frustration: Filters out noise and redundancy, making the essential information clear.
3. Increases Productivity: Enhances decision-making and response quality by providing concise summaries.
4. Improves Accessibility: Offers a more organized, visually friendly format for understanding complex threads.

**References & Inspiration**
Personally, did not do any reasearch yet. Was more inspired by the PAIN point I have in personal life and the spreadsheet of others' ideas. ChatGPT is suggesting there are other existing products for inspiration:
Existing AI-powered email summarizers like Superhuman and Gmail’s Smart Compose.
