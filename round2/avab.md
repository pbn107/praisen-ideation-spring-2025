# Chrome Extension Idea: Streets are Saying

## Authors

## Problem Statement

The problem I am trying to solve is that google maps reviews can have thousands of entries, so they are difficult to parse through. It would be helpful
to be able to use AI to summarize them, but there is not an easy way to copy all of the reviews to give to a chatbot. So, my extension
will provide a solution to this.

## Target Audience

This chrome extension will be useful to anyone exploring resturants or new locations, who is relying on the feedback of others.

## Description

This chrome extension will allow Google maps users to synthesize all of the reviews for a Yelp resturant with the touch of a button. The extension
will scrape the reviews and ask chat to summarize them. There will also be options for users to ask for more specific information such as 
Pros/Cons, Highlight Potential Flaws, Best Dishes, or other (user input). The user could also filter by the date of the review or other relevant factors
(i.e. number of stars).

## Selling Points

1. Saves time, eliminating need to read each review
2. More accurate review interpretation by compiling all of the information
3. Highlights important details that a quick glance over would miss
4. Leverages full scope of Yelp's power by synthesizing all reviews
5. Covenient to use, as it can be used right on the web page.

## User Stories

As a foodie, I want to get the most accurate understanding of restaurant reviews, so that I can pick the best place to eat.
As a busy person, I want to know if I restaurant will be good as quickly as I can, so that I don't waste my time.
As a frequent maps user, I want to know that my reviews can actually help people (rather than getting buried), so that I can actually make an impact.
As a picky eater, I want to know if any reviews mentioned this, so that I know the place I eat will meet my needs.

## Notes

The largest potential challenge will be deciding the scope, of how many reviews to scrape. 

## References & Inspiration

I was inspired by Aarti Sabharwal's idea in the Pre-Ideation doc, which talked about compiling product reviews. For me, though, I think restaurant/locations reviews would be more
interesting and useful to synthesize.
