## Problem Statement

Job seekers often browse through numerous job postings across platforms like Handshake, LinkedIn, and Indeed. However, it's tedious and time-consuming to manually extract, compare, and keep track of frequently required skills, especially for those applying across different roles or industries.

This lack of visibility into overlapping skill requirements makes it difficult for users to focus their learning and job preparation efficiently.

**SkillSpotter** addresses this by allowing users to highlight important content in job descriptions directly from their browser and automatically aggregates the key skills, creating a prioritized list of the most in-demand qualifications.

- **University students** preparing for internships or full-time roles
- **Recent graduates** entering the job market
- **Career switchers** looking to align their skillsets with current industry demands
- **Job seekers** using online platforms such as Handshake, LinkedIn, and Indeed
