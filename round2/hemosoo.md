# Chrome Extension Idea: LikeIm5

## Problem Statement

Sometimes the things you see on chrome, whether it's your chemistry lectures from last week, the daily headline, or even a random scientific journal you want to read are difficult to comprehend. No matter how many times you reread it, or try to understand the individual words or diagrams, you can't grasp the overall concept that the page encapsulates. Wouldn't it be insanely helpful if you could just have someone explain it to you like you're 5? LikeIm5 does exactly that!

## Target Audience

The target audience for LikeIm5 includes students, professionals, lifelong learners, and curious individuals who regularly browse dense or technical web content. These users often encounter complex information that is difficult to interpret on their own. Most are not subject matter experts, and they value quick, digestible explanations that help them understand new material efficiently. Accessibility-focused users, including ESL learners or neurodivergent individuals, would also benefit from clearer, simpler language.

## Description

LikeIm5 takes a screenshot of whatever page you're on, and sends it to an LLM with the prompt, "explain this page like I'm 5" allowing users to get a detailed yet easy to understand description of whatever is on the page. After the LLM finishes its answer, it is displayed to the user in a clear and concise fashion on the side, so the user can compare the LikeIm5 version with the actual content to gain a full understanding of the topic. 

## Selling Points

1. Converts complex information into accessible explanations in seconds.
2. Seamless integration with any webpage—no copy-pasting required.
3. Empowers users to learn independently without relying on outside help.
4. Supports students and researchers navigating difficult academic content.
5. Helpful for ESL users, neurodivergent learners, and anyone who prefers simplified language.

## Notes

A major challenge will be accurately parsing and screenshotting dynamic content such as embedded videos or charts.
We may need to incorporate OCR (optical character recognition) or use HTML scraping for better accuracy.
Future versions could include tone options (e.g., "explain like I'm 15" or "explain like a professor") to offer varying levels of complexity.
Privacy and security will be critical, especially if screenshots include sensitive or personal data.
