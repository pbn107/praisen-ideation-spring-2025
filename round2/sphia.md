# Chrome Extension Idea: Smart Email Calendar Scheduler

## Authors

Sphia Sadek

## Problem Statement

Scheduling meetings over email is often time-consuming and repetitive. When someone asks, "When are you free to meet next week?", users typically have to switch tabs, check their calendar, and manually type out their availability. This workflow is especially inefficient for busy professionals managing multiple events.

Our extension reduces this friction by automatically generating natural-language availability responses based on the user’s calendar, streamlining the scheduling process.

## Target Audience

 -Professionals and students with busy schedules

 -People who rely on Google Calendar or similar platforms for daily organization

 -Users who frequently coordinate meetings via email (e.g., managers, freelancers, academic advisors)

 -Individuals looking to automate repetitive communication tasks

## Description

This Chrome extension scans your Google Calendar when you receive scheduling-related emails. It drafts a polite, natural-language response suggesting your free time slots, such as:
“I’m free Monday 2–4pm, Wednesday after 3, or Friday morning — does any of that work for you?”

The user can review and edit the draft before sending.

## Selling Points

1. Saves time by eliminating the need to manually check and write availability

2. Generates natural, polite language rather than rigid calendar invites

3. Integrates directly into your email interface for seamless use

4. Integrates securely with Gmail and Google Calendar via OAuth

5. Works in the background with no need to switch apps

1. As a professional using Gmail, I want to automatically generate availability replies so that I don’t waste time checking my calendar manually.

2. As a user, I want the extension to suggest 2–3 optimal time slots from my calendar so that I can offer clear options.

3. As a user, I want to customize the tone or phrasing of the suggested reply so that it aligns with my communication style.

4. As a user, I want to preview and edit the reply before sending so that I maintain control over my communication.

5. As a user, I want the extension to only access my calendar with permission so that my data stays secure.

6. As a Gmail user, I want the extension to detect when someone asks about my availability so that I don’t have to search my calendar manually.

7. As a professional, I want the extension to suggest specific open time slots from my calendar so that I can quickly reply to meeting requests.

8. As a user, I want to review and edit the auto-generated availability message before sending it so that I maintain control over my communication.

9. As a frequent scheduler, I want the extension to avoid suggesting times when I have tentative or all-day events so that I don’t overbook.

10. As someone coordinating across time zones, I want the reply to include the time zone or convert suggestions to the recipient’s time zone when possible.

## Notes

_[Add any additional notes or considerations for your Chrome Extension idea. This could include potential challenges, alternative approaches, or specific features you want to highlight.]_
Requires OAuth integration with Google Calendar API

Natural-language generation can be rule-based for MVP, with option to improve via ML/NLP later

May use regex or pattern matching to detect scheduling request emails

Could include settings like “Only suggest mornings” or “Avoid Fridays”

Consider edge cases like conflicting meetings or all-day events

Must handle different time zones and calendar conflicts gracefully.

Could include settings for default meeting lengths, working hours, or preferred days.
