# Chrome Extension Idea: [AskThatPDF]

## Authors

Minyu Deng, Dominic Chang

## Problem Statement

Students often read lecture slides, research papers, or academic PDFs in their browser. When they encounter confusing terms or want to understand a section better, they typically switch tabs to search Google or ask ChatGPT. This constant context switching breaks focus, wastes time, and disrupts the learning experience.

AskThatPDF aims to solve this by integrating an AI-powered Q&A feature directly into the browser’s PDF viewer. Users can ask questions while reading, and get contextual answers based on the PDF content — all without leaving the page.

## Target Audience

The target audience for AskThatPDF includes:

University students studying various subjects who frequently read PDF-based materials

Students using AI tools to support their learning

Learners who value focus, streamlined workflows, and in-context explanations

## Description

AskThatPDF is a Chrome extension that activates when a user opens a PDF in the browser. It adds a lightweight sidebar where the user can ask questions. The extension extracts the text from the first few pages of the PDF and sends it, along with the user’s question, to the OpenAI API. The AI returns an answer based on the content, which is displayed instantly — no tab switching needed.

## Selling Points

1. Seamless in-page Q&A: Ask questions directly within the PDF viewer.

2. AI-powered understanding: Get contextual summaries and explanations instantly.

3. No copy-paste required: Automatically extracts relevant PDF content.

4. Lightweight and intuitive UI: Non-intrusive sidebar designed for focus.

5. Universal for any PDF: Works with most browser-opened PDFs.

## User Stories

1. As a student, I want to ask questions about a PDF without switching tabs so that I can stay focused while studying.

2. As a learner, I want to summarize the first few pages of a research paper so that I can quickly understand its key ideas.

3. As a CS major, I want to ask the plugin to explain an algorithm so that I can better grasp complex concepts in my slides.

4. As a student, I want to get answers from the content of a lecture PDF so that I don’t have to search manually.

5. As a user, I want the question and answer interaction to stay inside the PDF viewer so that my workflow remains uninterrupted.

6. As a non-native English speaker, I want to ask for simplified explanations of complex sentences in the PDF so that I can better understand academic texts.

7. As a psychology student, I want to highlight a paragraph and ask, "What does this mean in layman's terms?" so that I can quickly interpret technical language.

8. As a law student, I want to ask the plugin to extract and summarize legal definitions so that I can revise for exams more efficiently.

9. As a STEM student, I want to ask "What is the main conclusion of this article?" so that I can identify relevant papers for my research faster.

10. As a visually impaired student, I want the plugin to read out both my question and the AI’s answer using text-to-speech so that I can study with less visual strain.

## Notes

To reduce token costs and improve performance, limit PDF text extraction to the first 2–3 pages.

pdf.js will be used to extract PDF text directly from the current document.

Initial versions can use a mock API response for development/testing before integrating the real OpenAI API.

Consider later expansion to include features like "Summarize this page", "Translate section", or saving Q&A history.

Chrome Extensions can’t inject scripts into browser-native PDF viewers directly — consider wrapping pdf.js in an iframe or injecting into embedded viewers only.
