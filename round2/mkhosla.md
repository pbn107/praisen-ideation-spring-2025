It also can be challenging to determine if you have all the ingredients to make a certain recipe, or if you need to go shopping.

## Target Audience

The target audience includes home cooks, food enthusiasts, meal preppers, busy professionals, and parents looking for easier ways to manage meals. This can target also target those who discover recipes online regularly (blogs, Pinterest, etc.), cook at home frequently or aspire to do so, want a more efficient way to track what they need to buy, and are interested in reducing food waste by using what they already have.
