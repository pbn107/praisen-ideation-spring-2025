Chrome Extension Idea: Amazon Review Summarizer – Anders Amlie

Problem Statement

Since online goods are inherently harder to judge than when in-person shopping, reviews from actual people who bought the product are extremely important. Still, Amazon places these reviews at the absolute bottom of their long, clunky product pages. These reviews are both hard to navigate to and digest: they’re long, un-proofread pieces of text – this extension solves both by offering a cohesive pros and cons summary of a product in the click of a button.

Target Audience

Online shoppers


People doing quick product comparisons


Mobile-first or accessibility-focused users


Tech-savvy consumers looking for faster decision-making


Description
When on an Amazon product page, the extension scrapes the page of reviews, sends the text to GPT, and returns a clean, easy-to-read summary highlighting the most common pros and cons of the product. Results are shown in a popup or sidebar UI, triggered by clicking the extension icon.

Notes
Challenge: Avoid being blocked by rate-limiting if scraping too many reviews


Consideration: Could be extended to other review-heavy platforms like Yelp, eBay, or BestBuy later on


UI Ideas: Use a minimal sidebar, tooltip, or bottom card for the summary output. Match Amazon’s color scheme for seamless UX
